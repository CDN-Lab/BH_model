    "\n",
    "In this repository, we developed BHM to estimate parameters for value-based and confidence-based computational models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in modular form to analyze the model parameters from the following tasks: \n",
    "- CRDM: confidence and risky decision making \n",
    "- CDD: confidence and delay discounting\n",
    "- CDD_nlh: CDD nonlinear hyperbolic\n",
    "- CPDM: confidence and perceptual decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is also written to work for each of the studies that the Computational and Decision Neuroscience (CDN) lab is involved:\n",
    "- IDM: interoceptive decision making\n",
    "- SDM: States decision making\n",
    "- SDAN: CDN's collaboration with SDAN\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the script to work, the datafiles need to be stored in the appropriate [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format. We have the data located in a folder named `split` where each subject has a folder with the tasks they completed. Under each of the task directories, there is a spreadsheet with the naming convention `subjectname_task.csv`. Below you can see an example for how this looks like for the first 10 participants of the IDM project. "
